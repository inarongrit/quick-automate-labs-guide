# What You'll Build

In this advanced workshop, you'll build end-to-end automations that combine document extraction, data validation, and business rules processing—all orchestrated through specialized AI agents.

You'll build an end-to-end life insurance claims automation that transforms manual processing into an intelligent workflow. The system captures claim submissions, extracts data from death certificates using agentic AI, and verifies policy information through internal application integration. It automatically executes business rule engine via Model Context Protocol (MCP), manages human approvals, and generates decision letters. This automation significantly reduces processing time and manual effort while maintaining accuracy through built-in validation.
