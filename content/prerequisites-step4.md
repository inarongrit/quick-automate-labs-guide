- Share the connector to at least one user or group to share the connector with. Click Share to add the user to the list. Then, select either Owner or User permissions. Click the Add button.

- Owner permissions are recommended if you are granting the connector to your own alias/user. This enables you to share, edit and delete the connector after creation.
